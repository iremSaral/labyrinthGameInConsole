<p align="center">
  <i>I developed this simple game during my second term in Computer Engineering education, using C# programming language and Visual Studio platform. The game consists of a 10x10 grid, where three random paths are generated. In this grid, '1' represents a path and '0' represents a wall. Additionally, there are two bombs generated within these paths, which are represented by '2'.</i>

  <b>The player's goal is to reach the destination without getting caught by the bombs. They can navigate through the grid by pressing the following keys: "W" to move forward, "D" to move right, "A" to move left, and "S" to move backward. The player can also press the "G" key to reveal the location of the bombs. You will earn 1 point for each step you take without getting caught by the bombs. However, colliding with a wall will result in a deduction of points.</b>
